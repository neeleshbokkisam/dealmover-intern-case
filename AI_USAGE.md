# AI Usage Disclosure

This document tracks AI tool usage throughout the project development. AI was used strategically for specific tasks while maintaining human ownership of design and implementation decisions.

## Tools Used
- **Claude (Anthropic)**: Used for targeted assistance on specific development tasks

## Usage Log

### Project Setup Phase
- **Task**: Initial project structure and documentation
- **AI Role**: Suggested basic directory layout and documentation templates
- **Human Role**: Designed overall architecture, wrote all implementation code
- **Status**: ✅ Complete

### Backend Development
- **Task**: Django setup and PDF parsing implementation
- **AI Role**: Suggested Django project structure, provided regex patterns for financial data extraction, helped with error handling patterns
- **Human Role**: Designed overall API architecture, wrote core business logic, implemented PDF parsing strategy, made final decisions on pattern matching approach
- **Status**: ✅ Complete

### Frontend Development
- **Task**: React components and UI implementation
- **AI Role**: Suggested component structure, provided TypeScript interfaces, helped with API integration patterns and styling approach
- **Human Role**: Designed overall UI/UX workflow, implemented component logic, made decisions on state management and error handling, created comprehensive styling
- **Status**: ✅ Complete

### Testing & Documentation
- **Task**: Test implementation and final documentation
- **AI Role**: Suggested test script structure, validation approach, and pytest testing patterns
- **Human Role**: Designed comprehensive test strategy, implemented test script, validated API functionality with real PDF data, created pytest test suite with 27 comprehensive tests
- **Status**: ✅ Complete

## Usage Guidelines
- AI used for specific technical questions and code suggestions
- All AI outputs reviewed and adapted before implementation
- Human maintains full ownership of architectural decisions and final code quality
- Focus on strategic assistance rather than wholesale code generation
